# Intro
This repo is a CUDA/C++ based implementation of LDPC encoding/decoding algorithms
The intention is to validate against pyLDPC for correctness and speed profiling


# Setup

TODO
```
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```


# Benchmarks

cuLDPC vs pyLDPC
